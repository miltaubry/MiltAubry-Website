        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Milt Aubry and I was born and raised in San Diego. My whole life I have always been known for being really energetic and full of energy, but also serious, teachable and prepared when in the classroom. As someone who has always had so much energy, Iâ€™ve always played a lot of sports that include baseball, tennis, basketball, and football. Most of my free time has been spent playing these sports along with the occasional Saturday night out with the boys. Although my family is small with only both of my parents and myself I have for the most part always had a fun time throughout my childhood that has been filled with some great memories. As a shy youngster I always tended to have small friend group, but looking back on it I wouldnâ€™t change anything. All of these friends that I had growing up are still my best friends now. <br><br>

          These days you will find me as a student at the University of California Riverside where I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Economics. In my first year of college I went through some struggles to find my footing in such a big University but eventually I was able to get acclimated to my new life and recently have been enjoying myself. As a second year college student, one of the biggest things for me was to find the right group of friends that I actually felt a good connection with. Now with a great group of friends around me, I never feel like Iâ€™m alone in anything because they always have my back. Recently I have also found that time management is especially important with how much I have going on in my life right now. I really hope that everything that Iâ€™m doing right now will pay off in the future.
<br><br>

          After college, I have set some lofty goals for myself such as getting a job that pays me more than 200,000 dollars plus but at the same time is also a job that I enjoy. Recently, I entered the job market for a part time job and found one at Yogurtland. Although I had a great time working there in the month that I was there, I found myself not satisfied with the checks that I was receiving as I knew that I was worth more. This is why I decided to accept a job at Dominos as a Pizza Delivery Driver and since then I have been really happy with the pay and also with the coworkers who I work with. Hopefully if I save up enough money before the end of college I will be able to buy my first apartment and get my start in investing in Real Estate. As A 19 year old with so much to learn I am excited for what lies ahead. Hopefully in 10 years I will have an established career with a family of my own and a home that I can call my own.
